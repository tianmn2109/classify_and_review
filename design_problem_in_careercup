1: Suppose you want to design a application which will be receiving thousands of requests from many clients.
   And Application need to update received infomration to different servers in real time. What mechanism will you use? 
  
  For ex. Your application receives thousands of requests shares values along with exchange name from different client 
  and application need pass it to different exchange servers ex. Mumbai Exchange, NSE and few more. 
  Application need to pass information to specific servers in real time. 

  Here is sample data your application will receive in fraction of seconds from mutiple clients. 
  110 share1 BOMEXCHG 
  222 share2 BOMEXCHG 
  5677 share3 NSE 
  5690 share3 BOMEXCHG

  answer: 
  1:Queue mechanism with Event based architecture could be the better option.
  2: Goldman Sachs is still trying to Hire, eh? 
     It is a trivial problem with a very trivial solution.
     The precise formulation is this.
     Get a proxy for all exchanges - you can call them event sink so if you please.
     All are almost identical to one another.
     Get the file and send the data to the specific exchange proxy. You are done.
     The individual exchange proxies are command processors.
