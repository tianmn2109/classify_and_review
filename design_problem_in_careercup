1: Suppose you want to design a application which will be receiving thousands of requests from many clients.
   And Application need to update received infomration to different servers in real time. What mechanism will you use? 
  
  For ex. Your application receives thousands of requests shares values along with exchange name from different client 
  and application need pass it to different exchange servers ex. Mumbai Exchange, NSE and few more. 
  Application need to pass information to specific servers in real time. 

  Here is sample data your application will receive in fraction of seconds from mutiple clients. 
  110 share1 BOMEXCHG 
  222 share2 BOMEXCHG 
  5677 share3 NSE 
  5690 share3 BOMEXCHG

  answer: 
  1:Queue mechanism with Event based architecture could be the better option.
  2: Goldman Sachs is still trying to Hire, eh? 
     It is a trivial problem with a very trivial solution.
     The precise formulation is this.
     Get a proxy for all exchanges - you can call them event sink so if you please.
     All are almost identical to one another.
     Get the file and send the data to the specific exchange proxy. You are done.
     The individual exchange proxies are command processors.

2: Design an Email sender, need to send 100,000000 emails and you have 5 machines how could you do it efficiently.
  : 设计系统时，从以下几个方面分析：
      系统中有哪些对象，每个对象提供什么服务，最好能用API或者函数名写出服务，或者功能模块。

  answer:
  I think the interviewer was expecting a lot of questions to clarify. Sometimes, they keep the questions vague 
     intentionally.
  I am only going to consider the information provided here by OP and post my thoughts.

Requirements:
-> Send 100 Million emails (don't know the time frame, but assuming 1 day for now)
-> 5 machines to send emails. Client machine who sends the email is not included here
-> All machines are of same processing power

Let's go top down:

-> 100 Million emails can be divided into 5 machines, not necessary uniform, but approximately it would translate to 20 M 
  per machine
-> 20 M / 24 hours means 231 emails per sec
-> This means that there are 231 QPS required approximately for a single machine on an average

Email Service:
-> A service that would accept messages via open socket connection
-> Validates the message before sending it asynchronously 
-> Sends response back to caller/client with success failure. In case of failure, it sends appropriate Error messages
-> Has retry mechanism for certain types of errors (e.g. network error)
-> Uses message queuing system like Rabbit MQ to send messages (RabbitMQ can convert SMTP messages to AMQP) to send emails
-> You don't need this really since you are using Rabbit MQ, but can implement throttling using token bucket algorithm

Email Client Lib:
1. Validates the email content before sending it to Email Service (e.g. maximum size of attachment, parameters of the email,
etc.)
2. Compresses the message before sending to reduce network traffic
3. Retry logic in certain failure scenarios (e.g. in case email sever is busy, it can back off before retrying)

Client API can include following steps:
1. Setting SMTP Client : SetUpEmail(host, port, enableSSL, deliveryMethod, credentials)
2. Setting up Email: CreateEmail(sourceEmail, destEmail, subject, body, attachment)

Email Service APIs can be created in a similar way. I guess the idea here is to design than code. 

As of security, SMTP requires credentials. We are also compressing the packet while sending it on network and using SSL 
to send email. Should be pretty safe. You can add encryption from client to server in addition to compression, if your
email includes unicode characters.

We can discuss about the challenges of this design:
1. Availability: One of the machines might go down affecting the performance
2. Scalability: You can add more machines to make it scalable, but then you would have to update your design accordingly.

3：How would you design a price tracking website like camelcamelcamel.com? 
   For example, we might want the following behavior. Input: Item URL and target price. 
   Result: if the item goes below the target price, then users tracking the item will get an email alert. 

   Consider the following topics in the answer: database design (SQL or NoSQL), automated price checking mechanism, price scraping or price API, caching data.

   link： http://www.careercup.com/question?id=5734770984091648
   
   Following is the minimal DB design required to support the requirement

UserPriceTrackingData
User_id | Item_id | Price limit | expiry_date

ItemPrice
Item_id | Price

User
User_id | User_email

API's exposed:
1) UpdatePrice, params: item_id, price
Prices will be updated using UpdatePrice api and will be stored in ItemPrice table.
2) AddTrackingData, params: user_id, item_id, tracking price
User can enter price tracking data using AddTrackingData will be stored in UserPriceTrackingData with request 
expiry_date set to, say, 30 days later. If the price is already below the tracking price, a email is sent straightaway.

Worflow:
Whenever UpdatePrice is called to update the price, a background task will try match the UserPriceTrackingData entry 
for the item with tracking price larger than the new price. If a match is found, an email is sent.To expedite it, 
we can cache the tracking data for the most frequently updated items.
