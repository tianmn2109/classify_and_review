answer: 
Considering an unsigned 32 bit integer 
There are 2^32 possible values ( about 4 Billion ) 
Allocate a single bit for each value ( This would required 512 MB of memory ) 
Read the file, for each integer I, set ith bit to 1 
Once reading file is complete 
find the first bit which is not 1 
print the number corresponding to this bit.
