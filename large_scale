    answer1:
    I would probably say that maintain a minHeap should be a good way to go ! 

    1.) Assumption is that each paper has the a count that represents the number of times its been read. 

    Algorithm (basic idea): 

    1.) Everytime a paper is read. extract the min from the heap, and then check if the count is greater than or 
         equal to the paper extracted from the heap. 
    a.) If it is greater, search for the paper in the heap O(log n) 
    b.) change the count to count +1. O(1) 
    c.) call heapify to reflect the change O(log n) 
    2.) Obviously, if the count is less than the min paper extracted, just change the count of the paper to 
        count + 1 and don't do anything with the heap. 

    Note: Heap construction is based on the count (number of times a paper is read).
